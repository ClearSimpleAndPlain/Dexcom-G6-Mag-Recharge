# Dexcom-G6-Mag-Recharge-
### Rechargeable Dexcom board and steps

# WARNING!!!!.
### This is a DIY project that you will attach a LIPO battery to your body, This comes with risks and as such if you decide to build one for yourself you are doing so at your own risk and I will not be held responsible for any and all injuries or damages to you or your Transmitters.


Ok with that out of the way I have several test users that have had great success using their devices and figured it's time to share.
There are a lot of teardown video's out there for removing the battery from your Dexcom device so please look around.
There are a few differences in my design in the fact that we will be opening up the rear of the device and creating space for the battery.
This will require patients, skill, and a bit of luck.
